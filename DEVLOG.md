## 13 dev log

### Day 1 - 2020.06.01
- Uploaded project base to github
- Found a crazy issue about mobile resolution - trying to center a rect in the screen actually displays a quarter of it in the bottom-right corner. Did not find any solutions for that.
- Worked on another project that neared an important milestone - and had some succes with that

### Day 2 - 2020.06.02
- Revisited one of my older project stubs, which did not have this issue for some reason - still did not figure out why
- Spent some good time trying to solve that issue
- Gave up at 10pm and figured I'll just use `love.graphics.scale(0.5, 0.5)` as a workaround
Also additional coordinate transform
- simple packer script - should be later replaced by love-release
- Add Path base
- some github stuff
