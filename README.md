# 13

Recreation of a simple game

## To play

Grab a download from the releases page. The .love bundles need Löve2D version 11.3 or compatible. Works on every platform supported by Löve2D, but the main target is android - so just grab the apk version if you can.

You can also try out the web version (.html file), altought that's slower and hase a few sound issues.

## To build

Clone this repo **with submodules**, and enjoy.
I used [love-release](https://github.com/MisterDA/love-release) to make a bundle.

## The original

I got the idea from a mobile game "Make it 13" (later renamed to "Number merger infinity"), which was quite addictive, but poorly implemented, and had quite a few ads.

## Project goals

 Functional game:  

- board, cells, merging, animations
- menus
- background images, background ambient music
- highscores
- works on android

Project due date: 2020.06.14
I should put all my other sideprojects aside for that time!
